# How Did They Vote
### Summary
**A demo is available [here](https://somemone0.github.io/how-did-they-vote)**

This project creates a live voting area app that tracks the user's location, and where that area voted. Built primarily from a React application,
the app uses a Census API to get the census block at the user's coordinates, then uses a Flask API I built to match that census block to voter data.
With this information, the user is presented with the block's lean in the 2020 US election, and the block's swing from the 2016 election. By
selecting the buttons on the top of the screen, the user can select the elections tracked by the DRA dataset (they change by state). Swings are available for non-presidential elections as well, but they only track swings between types of elections, not individual candidates. (The swing from the 2016 to 2018 Senate elections in Wisconsin tracks two different races, Baldwin-Vukmir and Johnson-Feingold)
### Reflection

My favorite part about this project was the tangibility of its results. After building its first iteration, me and a friend drove around our town, just reading off the results it gave us. The project represents not only a webpage, but real data about the world. It added context to the world around me. Using live location data was also interesting, and I studied how Census Blocks and GEOIDs worked. Setting up the Flask backend on a small VPS, I learned about DNS systems, SSL, and deepened my knowledge of Linux management.
